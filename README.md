# Fast-Meal-Recipes

Create a webapp that can generate random meal recipes with the press of a button. Make it so that the user doesn’t need to create a user account, but they can save their favorite recipes via localstorage. You can use an API to fetch the data. Don’t worry about styling it yet. Just start with functionality.
